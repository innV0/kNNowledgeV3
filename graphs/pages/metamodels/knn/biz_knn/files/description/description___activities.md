# Activities

**description**

an activity list, in the context of business modeling, refers to the comprehensive set of tasks or processes that a business undertakes to create, deliver, and capture value for its customers. This includes everything from the initial ideation and development of a product or service, to its production, marketing, sales, and after-sales service. 

The purpose of an activity list is to provide a clear and structured overview of the business operations, identify the key value-creating activities, and ensure that they are effectively aligned with the business strategy and customer needs. It serves as a roadmap for the business, guiding its actions and decisions, and helping it to optimize its resources, improve its efficiency, and enhance its value proposition.

For example, consider a restaurant business. Its activity list might include tasks such as sourcing and purchasing ingredients, preparing and cooking meals, serving customers, managing reservations, maintaining the restaurant premises, marketing and promoting the restaurant, and handling customer feedback and complaints. Each of these activities contributes to the overall value that the restaurant provides to its customers, and hence, to its success and profitability.

In essence, an activity list is not just a to-do list for a business. It is a strategic tool that helps a business to understand and manage its operations, focus on its core competencies, and create a unique and compelling value proposition for its customers. It is a critical aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the business's ability to meet its objectives and satisfy its customers.
