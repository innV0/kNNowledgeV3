# Resources

**description**

"resource list" in business modeling refers to the tangible and intangible assets, capabilities, and infrastructure that a business utilizes to create and deliver value to its customers. This can encompass a wide range of resources, from physical assets like buildings and equipment, to human resources like employees and their skills, to intellectual property like patents and trademarks.

The resource list is a critical component of a business model because it outlines the foundational elements that a company needs to operate effectively and competitively. It provides a clear picture of what the company has at its disposal to create its products or services, serve its customers, and achieve its business objectives.

For example, a manufacturing company's resource list might include its production facilities, machinery, raw materials, and workforce. A software company, on the other hand, might list its software development tools, servers, proprietary algorithms, and the expertise of its developers.

In addition to identifying the resources, a resource list also often includes an assessment of their condition and performance. This can help the company identify any gaps or weaknesses in its resources that need to be addressed, and also highlight its strengths and competitive advantages.

In the context of business modeling, the resource list is often used to inform strategic planning and decision-making. It can help the company determine where to invest its resources, how to allocate them effectively, and how to leverage them to create and deliver value to its customers.

In essence, "resource list" in business modeling is about identifying and understanding the key resources that a company needs to operate and succeed. It's a crucial aspect of business design, as it can significantly impact a company's operational efficiency, competitive advantage, and overall business performance.
