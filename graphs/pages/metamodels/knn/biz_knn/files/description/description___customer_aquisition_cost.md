# Customer Aquisition Cost

**description**

Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC), in the context of business modeling, refers to the total cost that a business incurs to attract and convert a potential customer into an actual customer. This includes all the expenses related to marketing and sales activities, such as advertising, promotions, sales personnel salaries, commissions, and any other costs associated with the customer acquisition process.

The purpose of calculating the CAC is to understand how much a business is spending to acquire each new customer. This is a critical metric for any business, as it directly impacts its profitability and sustainability. If the CAC is too high, it means that the business is spending too much to acquire customers, which can erode its profits and even lead to losses. On the other hand, if the CAC is too low, it might indicate that the business is not investing enough in customer acquisition, which can limit its growth and market share.

For example, consider an online retail business that spends $100,000 on a marketing campaign and acquires 1,000 new customers as a result. The CAC in this case would be $100 (i.e., $100,000 / 1,000 customers). This means that the business needs to generate at least $100 in profit from each new customer, just to cover the cost of acquiring them.

In essence, the CAC is not just a cost figure for a business. It is a strategic metric that helps a business to assess the effectiveness of its marketing and sales efforts, optimize its customer acquisition strategies, and ensure its financial health. It is a crucial aspect of business design, as it directly influences the business's growth, profitability, and long-term success.
