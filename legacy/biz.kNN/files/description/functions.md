# Functions

**description**

"Function List" in business modeling refers to a high-level specification of the tasks that are necessary to carry out a business activity towards the achievement of a business goal. This list is a crucial component of a business model as it outlines the key functions or tasks that need to be performed to deliver a product or service, create value for customers, and achieve the business objectives.

The function list is typically organized in a logical sequence, starting from the initial stages of the business process to the final stages. Each function or task in the list is clearly defined and includes details such as the resources required, the expected output, and the responsible party or department.

For example, in a manufacturing business, the function list might include tasks such as sourcing raw materials, production, quality control, packaging, distribution, and customer service. Each of these tasks is essential for the business to produce and deliver its products to the customers.

The function list is not just a to-do list; it is a strategic tool that helps businesses to plan and manage their operations efficiently. It allows businesses to identify the key activities that drive value creation and focus their resources and efforts on these activities. It also helps to identify potential bottlenecks or inefficiencies in the business process and find ways to improve them.

Moreover, the function list can be used as a communication tool to clarify roles and responsibilities within the organization and ensure that everyone understands what needs to be done to achieve the business goals.

In conclusion, the "Function List" concept in business modeling is a vital tool that helps businesses to plan, manage, and optimize their operations towards the achievement of their business goals.
