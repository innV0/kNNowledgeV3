# Funding sources

**description**

Funding Sources in business modeling refers to the diverse ways a business model generates revenue or acquires capital to support its operations. This concept is crucial as it directly impacts the financial sustainability and growth potential of a business.

Funding Sources can be broadly categorized into two types: internal and external. Internal funding sources are generated within the business and include revenues from sales, profits retained in the business, and depreciation provisions. These sources are typically recurring and are closely linked to the business's operational performance.

External funding sources, on the other hand, are funds obtained from outside the business. These can include equity capital from shareholders, loans from financial institutions, grants, and subsidies from government bodies, and investments from venture capitalists or angel investors. External funding sources are often used for significant business expansion or development projects.

The choice of funding sources depends on various factors such as the business's stage of development, its financial health, the nature of its operations, and its strategic objectives. For instance, a startup might rely heavily on external funding sources like venture capital and angel investment, while a mature business might primarily use its internal funding sources.

The Funding Sources model is a vital part of business design as it determines how a business finances its operations, invests in growth, and manages financial risks. It also influences other aspects of the business model, such as the value proposition, customer segments, and cost structure.

For example, a software company might generate revenue through subscription fees (an internal funding source) and also raise capital through a series of funding rounds with venture capitalists (an external funding source). These funding sources would support the company's operations, fund its growth initiatives, and shape its business model.

In summary, the Funding Sources model provides a framework for identifying, evaluating, and managing the various ways a business generates revenue or acquires capital. It is a critical component of business design, influencing the business's financial sustainability, growth potential, and overall business strategy.
