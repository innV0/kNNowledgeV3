**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, "customer relationships" and "channels" are two of the nine key components that directly relate to communication. "Customer relationships" describes the types of relationships a company establishes with specific customer segments, while "channels" describe how a company communicates and reaches its customer segments to deliver a value proposition.
