# Funding sources

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, "revenue streams" is one of the nine key components. This refers to the ways a company generates income from each customer segment. It includes all the methods of generating revenue, which could be through direct sales, licensing, subscription fees, advertising, etc. This component is closely related to the funding sources of a business model.
**SWOT Analysis**
The SWOT analysis can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of existing funding sources and to identify new opportunities or threats in the realm of finance. For example, a strength could be a reliable source of funding, while a threat could be a potential change in the economic environment that could affect funding.
**PESTEL Analysis**
The PESTEL analysis can help identify how external factors affect a company's funding sources. For example, changes in economic conditions can affect the availability of funding, while changes in legal regulations can affect the types of funding a company can access.
**Porter's Five Forces**
This tool can be used to analyze the competitive environment and its impact on a company's funding sources. For example, the bargaining power of buyers could affect a company's revenue, while the threat of new entrants could affect a company's market share and thus its revenue.
**Financial Projections**
Financial projections, including income statements, balance sheets, and cash flow statements, are essential tools for planning and managing a company's funding sources. They provide a detailed view of a company's financial situation and can help identify potential funding gaps.
**Venture Capital Method**
This method is used by venture capitalists to estimate the value of a company and thus determine the amount of funding they are willing to provide. It takes into account the expected future profits of the company, the exit value of the company, and the level of risk associated with the investment.
**Crowdfunding Platforms**
Platforms like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, and GoFundMe have become popular tools for businesses to raise funds. These platforms allow businesses to reach a large number of potential investors and provide a platform for showcasing their business ideas and products.
