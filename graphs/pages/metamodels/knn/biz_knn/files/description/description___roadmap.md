# Roadmap

**description**

"Roadmap" in business modeling is a strategic plan that outlines the steps and strategies needed to implement a business model solution. This roadmap serves as a guide for businesses to navigate their way from their current state to their desired future state. It is a critical tool for managing change, driving alignment, and facilitating decision-making within a business.

Here are the key aspects of "Roadmap" in business modeling:

- Vision: This is the desired future state of the business. The vision should be clear, compelling, and aligned with the business's strategic objectives. For example, a retail business might envision becoming the leading provider of sustainable fashion in its market.

- Steps: These are the specific actions that the business needs to take to move from its current state to its desired future state. The steps should be practical, measurable, and aligned with the business's resources and capabilities. For example, the retail business might need to source sustainable materials, design eco-friendly products, and develop green manufacturing processes.

- Strategies: These are the approaches that the business will use to execute the steps. The strategies should be effective, flexible, and aligned with the business's competitive environment. For example, the retail business might use a combination of partnerships, acquisitions, and organic growth to achieve its vision.

- Milestones: These are the key achievements that the business aims to reach along its journey. The milestones should be significant, achievable, and aligned with the business's timeline. For example, the retail business might aim to launch its first sustainable product line within one year.

By developing a "Roadmap", a business can ensure that it is moving in the right direction, making progress towards its vision, and creating value for its stakeholders. For instance, the retail business might use its roadmap to guide its transition to sustainable fashion, track its progress, and communicate its achievements to its customers, employees, and investors. This would demonstrate the business's ability to leverage its "Roadmap" to drive its business model and create value.
