# Presentations

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, the "Value Proposition" component is often presented visually to stakeholders. This can be done through presentations that clearly articulate the unique value the business offers to its customers. The presentation can also include other components of the canvas to provide a holistic view of the business model.
**Pitch Deck**
A pitch deck is a presentation used by startups to provide a brief overview of their business plan. It typically includes information about the problem the business is solving, the solution, the target market, the business model, the team, and financial projections. This tool is often used to communicate the business model to potential investors.
**Storytelling**
Storytelling is a powerful tool for presenting a business model. By weaving the components of the business model into a compelling narrative, businesses can engage stakeholders on an emotional level and make the model more memorable and persuasive.
**Infographics**
Infographics can be used to visually represent a business model in a clear and engaging way. They can simplify complex information and make it easier for stakeholders to understand the business model. Infographics can be included in presentations to enhance communication.
**Value Proposition Canvas**
This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is often used in conjunction with the Business Model Canvas. It provides a more detailed view of the "Value Proposition" and "Customer Segment" components of the business model. The canvas can be presented to stakeholders to provide a deeper understanding of how the business creates value for its customers.
**SWOT Analysis**
A SWOT analysis can be presented to stakeholders to provide a clear overview of the business's strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats. This can help stakeholders understand the business's competitive position and the external and internal factors that could affect its success.
**PESTEL Analysis**
A PESTEL analysis can be used in presentations to provide stakeholders with a comprehensive understanding of the external factors that could impact the business. This can help stakeholders understand the broader context in which the business operates.
