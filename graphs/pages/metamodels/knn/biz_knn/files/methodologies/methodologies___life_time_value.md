# Life Time Value

**methodologies**

**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV) Model**
This model is specifically designed to calculate the total revenue a business can reasonably expect from a single customer account. It considers a customer's revenue value and compares that number to the company's predicted customer lifespan. Businesses use this prediction to identify significant customer segments that are the most valuable to the company.
**Net Present Value (NPV) Method**
The NPV method is a financial forecasting model that can be used to calculate the lifetime value of a customer. It involves discounting future cash flows from a customer to the present value, which gives a business an idea of how much a customer relationship is worth in today's dollars.
**Data-Driven Marketing**
This approach uses customer data to optimize strategies based on customer behavior, including purchase history, engagement, and other interactions. By understanding these behaviors, businesses can predict future behavior and calculate the lifetime value of a customer.
**Predictive Analytics**
Predictive analytics involves using statistical algorithms and machine learning techniques to identify the likelihood of future outcomes based on historical data. It can be used to calculate the lifetime value of a customer by predicting future interactions and revenue based on past behavior.
**Cohort Analysis**
Cohort analysis is a type of behavioral analytics that takes data from a given dataset and rather than looking at all users as one unit, it breaks them into related groups for analysis. These related groups, or cohorts, usually share common characteristics within a defined time-span. This can be used to calculate the lifetime value of different cohorts, helping to understand how this value varies between different groups.
**RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) Analysis**
RFM analysis is a marketing technique used to quantitatively rank and group customers based on the recency, frequency, and monetary total of their recent purchases to identify the best customers and understand aspects of their behavior. This can be used to calculate the lifetime value of different customer groups, and to develop strategies to increase the lifetime value of different segments.
