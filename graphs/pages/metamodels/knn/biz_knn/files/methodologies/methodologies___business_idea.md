# Business idea

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, the business idea is essentially the foundation of the entire model. It is the unique concept or proposition that the business is built around. This idea is then broken down into the nine key components of the canvas, which include value propositions, customer segments, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure.
**Lean Startup Methodology**
The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, is built around the concept of developing a business idea through a process of validated learning. This involves quickly building a minimum viable product (MVP) based on the business idea, measuring how it performs in the market, and learning from that data to iterate and improve the product.
**Blue Ocean Strategy**
The Blue Ocean Strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne, is a business model that focuses on creating new demand in an uncontested market space, or "Blue Ocean", rather than competing in an existing market. The business idea is the unique concept or proposition that allows the company to create this new market space.
**Value Proposition Canvas**
The Value Proposition Canvas, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is a tool that helps businesses to design compelling value propositions that customers will love. The business idea is the unique concept or proposition that forms the basis of the value proposition.
**SWOT Analysis**
The SWOT analysis can be used to evaluate the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to a business idea. This can help to identify potential challenges and opportunities for the business idea in the market.
**PESTEL Analysis**
The PESTEL analysis can be used to identify how external factors (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, and Legal) may affect the implementation and success of a business idea. This can help to identify potential opportunities and threats in the external environment that could impact the business idea.
