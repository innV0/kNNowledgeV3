# Phases

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, the "phases" can be interpreted as the process of developing and refining the nine key components of the business model. This includes identifying and understanding the customer segments, value propositions, channels, customer relationships, revenue streams, key resources, key activities, key partnerships, and cost structure. The process is iterative and evolves over time as the business grows and adapts to changes in the market.
**Lean Startup Methodology**
The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, includes distinct phases in the development and implementation of a business model. These phases are "Build-Measure-Learn". The idea is to turn business ideas into products or services, measure how customers respond, learn whether to pivot or persevere, and repeat this process until the right product/market fit is found.
**Design Thinking**
Design Thinking is a methodology that includes distinct phases in the development of a business model. These phases are "Empathize-Define-Ideate-Prototype-Test". The process starts with understanding the customer needs, defining the problem, generating ideas, creating prototypes, and testing the solutions. The process is iterative and can be repeated as many times as necessary until the desired outcome is achieved.
**Agile Methodology**
Agile methodology, often used in software development, can also be applied to business model development. The phases in Agile include "Requirements, Design, Development, Testing, Deployment, Review". The process is iterative, with each phase being revisited in response to the insights gained in the previous phase.
**Blue Ocean Strategy**
The Blue Ocean Strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne, includes distinct phases in the development and implementation of a business model. These phases are "Reconstruct Market Boundaries, Focus on the Big Picture, Reach Beyond Existing Demand, Get the Strategic Sequence Right". The process involves creating a new market space (blue ocean), rather than competing in an existing market (red ocean).
