**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, the "Key Resources" block refers to the most important assets necessary to make a business model work. These resources allow an enterprise to create and offer a value proposition, reach markets, maintain relationships with customer segments, and earn revenues. They can be physical, intellectual, human, or financial.
**Value Chain Analysis**
This tool, developed by Michael Porter, is used to analyze the activities through which a firm can create value and competitive advantage. It includes primary activities (like inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service) and support activities (like procurement, technology development, human resource management, and firm infrastructure) that use the company's resources.
**VRIO Framework**
The VRIO framework is a tool for analyzing a company's internal resources and capabilities to see if they can be a source of sustained competitive advantage. The acronym stands for Value, Rarity, Imitability, and Organization. This tool helps to evaluate the strategic value of a company's resources.
**SWOT Analysis**
The SWOT analysis can be used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a company's resources. Strengths could include a strong brand, loyal customer base, strong financial resources, etc. Weaknesses could include lack of patent protection, a weak brand, poor reputation among customers, etc.
**Resource-Based View (RBV)**
The Resource-Based View is a method of analyzing and identifying a firm's strategic advantages based on the examination of the combination of its resources. It emphasizes the importance of firm-specific resources that are valuable, rare, inimitable, and non-substitutable (VRIN) to gain and maintain competitive advantage.
**Balanced Scorecard**
The Balanced Scorecard is a strategic planning and management system that organizations use to align business activities with the vision and strategy of the organization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor organization performance against strategic goals. It includes financial measures that tell the results of actions already taken, and operational measures on customer satisfaction, internal processes, and the organization's innovation and improvement activitiesâ€”the drivers of future financial performance.
