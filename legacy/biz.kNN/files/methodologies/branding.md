**methodologies**

**Brand Identity Prism**
Developed by Jean-Noel Kapferer, the Brand Identity Prism is a model that businesses can use to develop a strong brand. The prism has six components: physique, personality, culture, relationship, reflection, and self-image. These elements help a business to create a unique and comprehensive brand identity.
**Brand Positioning Canvas**
This tool helps businesses to define their brand's unique position in the market. It includes elements such as brand purpose, values, personality, and positioning statement. By using this canvas, businesses can create a brand that stands out from the competition.
**Brand Equity Model**
Also known as the Brand Resonance Model, this tool was developed by Kevin Lane Keller. It outlines the process of building a strong brand through four steps: brand identity, brand meaning, brand response, and brand resonance. This model helps businesses to understand how to create a brand that resonates with customers and builds loyalty.
**SWOT Analysis**
While SWOT Analysis is a general tool, it can be used to evaluate a brand's strengths and weaknesses, and to identify opportunities and threats in the market. This can help businesses to understand where their brand stands and how to improve it.
**PESTEL Analysis**
By analyzing Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Ecological, and Legal factors, companies can understand how these external factors affect their brand. For example, social trends can influence how a brand is perceived, while legal factors can affect how a brand can be marketed.
**Brand Archetypes**
This tool, based on the archetypes defined by psychologist Carl Jung, helps businesses to define their brand's personality. By choosing an archetype that fits their brand, businesses can create a consistent and relatable brand identity.
