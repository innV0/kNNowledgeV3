**methodologies**

**RACI Matrix**
The RACI Matrix is a responsibility assignment chart that maps out every task, milestone, or key decision involved in completing a project and assigns which roles are Responsible, Accountable, Consulted, and Informed. It's a tool that clearly defines team roles and responsibilities in the context of a business model.

**Belbin Team Roles**
This model is used to identify people's behavioural strengths and weaknesses in the workplace. It can help to build productive teams, where each team member has a clear role. The Belbin Team Roles model can be used in the context of a business model to ensure that the team is balanced and all necessary skills are covered.

**Tuckman's Stages of Group Development**
This model describes the phases which teams tend to go through from their inception to the completion of the project: forming, storming, norming, performing, and adjourning. Understanding these stages can help a business model to plan for potential team challenges and dynamics.

**SWOT Analysis**
While typically used for strategic planning, SWOT Analysis can also be applied to teams within a business model. Strengths and weaknesses can be identified within the team, and opportunities and threats in the external environment that could impact the team's performance can be explored.

**Scrum**
Scrum is an agile framework for managing work, with an emphasis on software development. It is designed for teams of three to nine members, who break their work into actions that can be completed within timeboxed iterations. This methodology can be incorporated into a business model to manage and improve the efficiency of a team.

**Kanban**
Kanban is a visual system for managing work as it moves through a process. It visualizes both the process (the workflow) and the actual work passing through that process. The goal of Kanban is to identify potential bottlenecks in your process and fix them so work can flow through it cost-effectively at an optimal speed or throughput. It's a tool that can be used to manage team workflow within a business model.
