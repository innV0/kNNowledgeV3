# Competition

**description**

"Competition" in business modeling refers to the analysis and understanding of other businesses that offer similar products or services in the same market. This involves identifying who these competitors are, understanding their strategies, strengths, and weaknesses, and determining how they could potentially impact your business.

In the "Competition" model, businesses use various tools and techniques to gather and analyze information about their competitors. This could involve conducting market research, analyzing competitors' marketing strategies, assessing their product offerings, and monitoring their pricing strategies. The goal is to gain a comprehensive understanding of the competitive landscape and to identify opportunities and threats.

For example, a new restaurant might analyze the competition in its local area to understand what types of cuisine are already being offered, what price points are common, and what unique selling propositions other restaurants are promoting. This information could then be used to develop a unique and competitive business model that fills a gap in the market.

Alternatively, a tech startup might analyze the competition in its industry to understand the key features and benefits of competing products, the marketing strategies being used, and the overall market share of different competitors. This information could then be used to develop a product that offers unique features or benefits, or to create a marketing strategy that differentiates the startup from its competitors.

The "Competition" concept in business modeling is crucial because it helps businesses to understand the competitive landscape and to develop strategies that will allow them to compete effectively. This can lead to increased market share, customer loyalty, and ultimately, business success.
