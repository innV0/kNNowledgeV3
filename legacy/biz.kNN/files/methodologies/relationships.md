**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, "relationships" are one of the nine key components. This refers to the type of relationship a company establishes with its customer segments. It could be personal, automated, self-service, or others. The nature of these relationships can have a significant impact on the overall customer experience and thus, the success of the business model.
**Stakeholder Analysis**
This tool is used to identify and understand the needs and interests of major stakeholders. It can be used to analyze the relationships a company has with its stakeholders, and how these relationships can be managed to support the company's strategic objectives.
**Customer Relationship Management (CRM)**
CRM systems are used to manage a company's interactions with its customers. They can provide valuable insights into the nature of the company's relationships with its customers, including the level of personalization, the frequency of interaction, and the channels used for communication.
**Value Proposition Canvas**
This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, focuses on the value proposition a company offers to its customers and the type of relationship it establishes with them. It can be used to design and innovate these relationships to better meet the needs and expectations of the customers.
**Empathy Map**
An Empathy Map is a tool used to gain a deeper insight into the customers. By understanding the customers' needs, thoughts, emotions, and motivations, companies can design more effective and meaningful relationships with them.
**Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
NPS is a tool used to measure the loyalty of a company's customer relationships. It can provide valuable insights into the quality of these relationships and how they can be improved.
