**prompts**

`Draft a one-slide “elevator pitch” summarizing the problem, solution, and opportunity.`
`What core metrics (e.g., TAM, growth rate) should we highlight to investors?`
`How can we tailor our pitch to address VC vs. strategic investors?`
`Which storytelling structure will make our pitch most persuasive?`
`What supporting visuals or data should accompany each slide?`
