# Contracts

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, the "Key Partnerships" component can be related to the contract list. This section outlines the network of suppliers and partners that make the business model work, which would include any contractual agreements or legal obligations between the business and its stakeholders.
**Porter's Five Forces**
This tool, developed by Michael Porter, can be used to analyze the competitive environment of a business. One of the five forces is "Bargaining power of suppliers", which can be influenced by the contracts a business has with its suppliers. A comprehensive contract list can help a business understand its dependencies and negotiate better terms.
**Value Chain Analysis**
Value Chain Analysis is a strategy tool used to analyze internal firm activities. Its goal is to recognize, which activities are the most valuable to the firm and which ones could be improved to provide a competitive advantage. Here, a contract list can be used to identify key activities that are underpinned by contractual agreements.
**Risk Management Frameworks**
Contract lists are crucial in risk management. They help identify potential risks associated with each contract, such as non-compliance, non-performance, or financial risks. This can be done using various risk management frameworks, such as ISO 31000 or COSO ERM.
**Stakeholder Analysis**
This tool is used to identify and understand the needs and expectations of major stakeholders. A contract list can be a useful input to this process, as it provides a clear picture of the formal relationships between the business and its stakeholders.
