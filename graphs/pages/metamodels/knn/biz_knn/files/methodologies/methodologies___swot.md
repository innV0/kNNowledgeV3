**Brand Storytelling Framework**
This tool helps businesses to craft a compelling narrative that communicates their brand's purpose, values, and mission. It includes elements such as the brand's history, vision, mission, values, personality, and customer promise. The framework guides businesses in telling their story in a way that resonates with their target audience and differentiates them from their competitors.

**Hero's Journey**
The Hero's Journey, or the Monomyth, is a narrative pattern identified by Joseph Campbell that appears in drama, storytelling, myth, religious ritual, and psychological development. It describes the typical adventure of the archetype known as The Hero, the person who goes out and achieves great deeds on behalf of the group, tribe, or civilization. Businesses can use this pattern to structure their brand storytelling, positioning their customers as the heroes and themselves as the guides.

**StoryBrand Framework**
Developed by Donald Miller, the StoryBrand Framework is a 7-part storytelling tool that helps businesses clarify their brand message. It guides businesses in creating a story where the customer is the hero, the business is the guide, and the product or service is the tool that helps the hero overcome their problem and achieve their goal.

**Transmedia Storytelling**
This approach involves creating and sharing a narrative across multiple platforms and formats, using the benefits of each to enhance the overall storytelling. It allows businesses to engage with their audience in a variety of ways and to communicate their brand's purpose, values, and mission in a more immersive and interactive manner.

**Narrative Transportation Theory**
This theory suggests that when people lose themselves in a story, their attitudes and intentions change to reflect that story. Businesses can use this theory to create compelling brand stories that 'transport' their audience and influence their perceptions and behaviors.

**Emotional Branding**
Developed by Marc Gob√©, this approach focuses on building brands that appeal directly to a consumer's emotional state, needs and aspirations. Emotional branding involves creating a story that will resonate with target customers on an emotional level, helping to build strong and lasting relationships.
