# Costs

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, "cost structure" is one of the nine key components. This refers to all the costs that a business will incur while operating under a specific business model. It includes both fixed and variable costs, and is directly related to the production and delivery of a product or service.
**Value Proposition Canvas**
This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, focuses on the value proposition and customer segment components of the Business Model Canvas. While it doesn't directly address cost lines, understanding the value proposition can help identify the key activities, resources, and partners that are necessary to deliver it, which in turn can help identify and estimate costs.
**Break-Even Analysis**
This is a financial tool that businesses use to determine the point at which they will start making a profit. It involves identifying and adding up all costs (both fixed and variable) and then determining how many units of a product or service must be sold at a given price to cover those costs.
**Activity-Based Costing (ABC)**
ABC is a method of assigning costs to products or services based on the resources that they consume. It's a more precise way of allocating overhead costs than traditional methods, and can provide a more accurate picture of cost lines related to the production and delivery of a product or service.
**Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)**
TCO is a financial estimate that helps consumers and enterprise managers determine direct and indirect costs of a product or system. It is a management accounting concept that can be used to model the monetary costs of "cost lines" over time.
**SWOT Analysis**
While SWOT analysis is a more general tool, it can be used to identify internal and external factors that could affect a company's cost lines. For example, a weakness might be high production costs, while an opportunity might be a new technology that could reduce those costs.
**PESTEL Analysis**
This tool can help businesses understand how external factors might affect their cost lines. For example, economic factors such as inflation or exchange rates could affect the costs of raw materials, while legal factors could lead to additional costs for compliance with new regulations.
