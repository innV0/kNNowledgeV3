# Mission

**description**

"mission" refers to the fundamental purpose or reason for the existence of a business. It is the driving force behind all business decisions and actions, providing a clear direction and focus for the organization. The mission is typically expressed in a mission statement, which is a brief, concise declaration of the business's core purpose.

The mission is a critical component of a business model as it defines the business's overall goals and guides its strategies and operations. It communicates what the business does, who it serves, and how it provides value to its customers or clients. The mission also serves as a motivational tool, inspiring employees and stakeholders to work towards the common goal.

For example, the mission of a non-profit organization might be "to provide educational opportunities for underprivileged children." This mission guides all of the organization's activities, from fundraising to program development. It also communicates to stakeholders - including donors, volunteers, and the community - what the organization is striving to achieve.

In essence, "mission" in business modeling is about defining and articulating the fundamental purpose of a business. It is a crucial element in business design, providing direction, focus, and motivation, and shaping the business's strategies and operations.
