# Financial Projections Tool - Context

## Application Scope

This financial projections application is specifically designed for desktop and laptop computers with wide screens. It is **not intended for use on mobile phones, smartphones, or tablets**.

## Design Considerations

### Desktop-First Approach
- **Wide tables**: The application displays extensive financial data across 60+ months with multiple configuration columns
- **Fixed + scrollable layout**: Metric names remain visible while scrolling through time periods
- **Complex sidebar**: Detailed editing controls require sufficient screen real estate
- **Horizontal scrolling**: Essential for navigating wide datasets

### Mobile Limitations
- **Screen width**: Mobile devices cannot properly display the wide table structure
- **Touch interactions**: The interface relies on precise mouse interactions
- **Data density**: Mobile screens cannot accommodate the information density required
- **Sidebar complexity**: The editing interface is too complex for mobile navigation

## Technical Requirements

### Minimum Screen Resolution
- **Width**: 1200px minimum recommended
- **Height**: 800px minimum recommended

### Browser Support
- **Modern desktop browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **JavaScript enabled**: Required for reactive calculations
- **Local file access**: May require local server for full functionality

## Usage Context

This tool is designed for:
- **Financial analysts** working on business projections
- **Startup founders** planning financial models
- **Business consultants** creating detailed forecasts
- **Desktop workstations** with multiple monitors preferred

## Data Management
