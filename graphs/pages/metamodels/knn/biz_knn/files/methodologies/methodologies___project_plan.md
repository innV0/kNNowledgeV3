**methodologies**

**Gantt Chart**
A Gantt chart is a visual representation of a project schedule, showing the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. It is a useful tool for planning and scheduling projects, managing the project's timeline, and visualizing the project plan in the context of the overall business model.
**Critical Path Method (CPM)**
CPM is a step-by-step project management technique for process planning that defines critical and non-critical tasks with the goal of preventing time-frame problems and process bottlenecks. It contributes to the project plan component of the business model by identifying the most critical tasks that directly impact the project timeline.
**Program Evaluation and Review Technique (PERT)**
PERT is a method to analyze the involved tasks in completing a given project, especially the time needed to complete each task, and identifying the minimum time needed to complete the total project. It helps in creating a realistic project plan and schedule.
**Agile Project Management**
Agile project management is an iterative approach to delivering a project throughout its life cycle. It is a flexible and interactive method that allows changes and adjustments to be made to the project plan as it progresses, ensuring that the project remains aligned with the overall business model.
**Waterfall Model**
The Waterfall Model is a sequential design process, used in project management, where progress is seen as flowing steadily downwards (like a waterfall) through the phases of conception, initiation, analysis, design, construction, testing, production/implementation, and maintenance. It provides a structured approach to project planning and execution.
**PRINCE2 (Projects IN Controlled Environments)**
PRINCE2 is a process-based method for effective project management. It provides a structured project management method and promotes project-based management disciplines. It is a project management methodology that aligns with the project plan component of the business model.
**Scrum**
Scrum is an agile framework for managing knowledge work, with an emphasis on software development. It is designed for teams of three to nine members, who break their work into actions that can be completed within time-boxed iterations. It allows for flexibility and adaptability in project planning, making it a valuable tool for the project plan component of the business model.
