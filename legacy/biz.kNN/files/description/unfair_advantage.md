# Unfair advantage

**description**

"Unfair Advantage" in business modeling refers to a unique benefit or set of benefits that a business possesses, which allows it to outperform its competitors. This could be anything from proprietary technology, exclusive partnerships, superior talent, or access to scarce resources. The key aspect of an unfair advantage is that it is not easily replicable or attainable by competitors, making it a powerful competitive edge.

In the "Unfair Advantage" model, the business leverages its unique advantages to create superior value for its customers and/or operate more efficiently than its competitors. This could involve using proprietary technology to offer a better product, leveraging exclusive partnerships to access markets or resources that competitors can't, or utilizing superior talent to provide exceptional service.

For example, a tech startup might have an unfair advantage in the form of a proprietary algorithm that allows it to offer a more effective solution than its competitors. This unfair advantage enables the startup to attract more customers and generate higher revenues, even if it's a smaller company with fewer resources.

Alternatively, a manufacturing company might have an unfair advantage in the form of an exclusive partnership with a key supplier. This allows the company to access high-quality materials at a lower cost than its competitors, enabling it to produce superior products and/or offer more competitive prices.

The "Unfair Advantage" concept in business modeling is crucial because it emphasizes the importance of leveraging unique benefits to achieve competitive superiority. It encourages businesses to identify, cultivate, and exploit their unique advantages to outperform their competitors and achieve greater success.
