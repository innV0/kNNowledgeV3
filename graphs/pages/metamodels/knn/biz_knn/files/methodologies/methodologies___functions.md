**Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)**
BPMN is a graphical representation for specifying business processes in a business process model. It provides businesses with a standard method of illustrating the flow of activities (functions) in a process, making it easier to understand and improve.
**Value Stream Mapping**
This lean-management method is used for analyzing the current state and designing a future state for the series of events that take a product or service from its beginning through to the customer. It helps to visualize and understand the flow of material and information as a product or service makes its way through the value stream.
**Gantt Chart**
A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. This chart lists the tasks to be performed on the vertical axis, and time intervals on the horizontal axis. The width of the horizontal bars in the graph shows the duration of each activity.
**Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)**
WBS is a key project deliverable that organizes the team's work into manageable sections. The Project Management Body of Knowledge (PMBOK) defines the work breakdown structure as a "hierarchical decomposition of the total scope of work to be carried out by the project team to accomplish the project objectives and create the required deliverables."
**Critical Path Method (CPM)**
CPM is an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities. It is a step-by-step project management technique to identify activities on the critical path. It is an approach to project scheduling that allows the project manager to manage the trade-off between the time and cost necessary to complete the project.
**Lean Six Sigma**
Lean Six Sigma is a method that relies on a collaborative team effort to improve performance by systematically removing waste and reducing variation. It combines lean manufacturing/lean enterprise and Six Sigma to eliminate the eight kinds of waste: Defects, Over-Production, Waiting, Non-Utilized Talent, Transportation, Inventory, Motion, and Extra-Processing.
