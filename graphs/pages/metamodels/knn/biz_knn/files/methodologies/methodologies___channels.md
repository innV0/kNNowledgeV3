# Channels

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, developed by Alexander Osterwalder, "channels" are one of the nine key components. In this context, channels refer to how a company communicates and delivers its value proposition to its customer segments. This includes both distribution channels and communication and marketing channels.
**Marketing Mix**
Within the tagic concept of the Marketing Mix, or the 4 P's (Product, Price, Place, and Promotion), the term "Place" refers to distribution channels. This implies how and where the product or service is sold. In this tool, the focus is more on the logistics of getting the product to the customer, including the selection of sales and distribution channels.
**SWOT Analysis**
Although the SWOT analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) is a more general tool, it can be used to evaluate the effectiveness of existing channels and to identify new opportunities or threats in the realm of distribution and communication channels.
**Customer Journey Map**
This tool focuses on mapping and understanding the complete customer experience with the company. Channels are a critical aspect here, as each point of contact on the customer journey map can be a different channel.
**PESTEL Analysis**
By analyzing Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Ecological, and Legal factors, companies can identify how these external factors affect their channels. For example, technological advancements can offer new distribution or communication channels.
