# Pitch

**description**

"Pitch" in business modeling refers to a succinct and persuasive presentation of a business idea or model to potential investors or customers. The purpose of a pitch is to convince the audience of the viability and potential profitability of a business concept, and to persuade them to invest in the idea or become customers.

A pitch typically includes a description of the product or service, an overview of the market and competition, a presentation of the business model and revenue streams, and a discussion of the team and their qualifications. It also often includes a financial forecast and a request for investment.

For example, a tech startup might pitch a new mobile app to potential investors. The pitch would include a demo of the app, an analysis of the market for the app and the competition, a presentation of the business model (e.g., freemium, subscription, advertising), a discussion of the team's background and skills, and a financial forecast showing the potential return on investment.

The pitch is a critical component of the entrepreneurial process. It is the primary tool entrepreneurs use to raise capital and attract customers. A successful pitch can secure the funding needed to launch or grow a business, and can attract the customers needed to make the business profitable.

In essence, "Pitch" in business modeling is about selling a business idea or model. It is a vital aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the ability of a business to secure funding and customers, and ultimately, its ability to succeed.
