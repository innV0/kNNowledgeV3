# Milestones

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, "milestones" can be considered as part of the "Key Activities" component. These are the most important actions a company must take to operate successfully. Milestones, as significant achievements or events, can be used to measure the progress of these key activities.
**OKR (Objectives and Key Results)**
OKR is a goal-setting framework that helps organizations set ambitious goals with measurable results. Milestones can be used as key results, which are specific, time-bound, and measurable outcomes that track the achievement of the objective.
**Gantt Chart**
A Gantt chart is a type of bar chart that illustrates a project schedule. Milestones, as significant events in the timeline, are often highlighted in Gantt charts to indicate major progress points or phases in the project.
**Critical Path Method (CPM)**
CPM is an algorithm for scheduling a set of project activities. In this method, milestones can be used to denote the start or end of major tasks or phases, helping to identify the critical path of the project.
**Balanced Scorecard**
The Balanced Scorecard is a strategic planning and management system used to align business activities with the vision and strategy of the organization. Milestones can be used within this framework to track the progress of strategic objectives across various perspectives (financial, customer, internal process, learning and growth).
**Lean Startup Methodology**
In the Lean Startup methodology, milestones are often used in the "Build-Measure-Learn" feedback loop. They can mark significant points in the process, such as the completion of a minimum viable product (MVP), pivot points, or validation of a key hypothesis.
