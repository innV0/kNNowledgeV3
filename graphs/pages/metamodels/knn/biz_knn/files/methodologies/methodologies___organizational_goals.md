**Balanced Scorecard**
The Balanced Scorecard, developed by Robert Kaplan and David Norton, is a strategic planning and management system used extensively in business and industry, government, and nonprofit organizations worldwide to align business activities to the vision and strategy of the organization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor organization performance against strategic goals. It provides a framework that not only provides performance measurements, but helps planners identify what should be done and measured.
  
**OKR (Objectives and Key Results)**
OKR is a goal-setting framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes. The main goal of OKR is to define company and team "objectives" along with the measurable "key results" that define achievement of each objective. The goal of OKR is to ensure that everyone is moving in the same direction, with clear priorities, at a constant pace, channeling efforts, assuring coordination and connecting different areas.

**SMART Goals**
SMART is an acronym that stands for Specific, Measurable, Achievable, Relevant, and Time-bound. When setting goals, these factors are considered to ensure that the goals are clear and reachable. Each SMART goal you create is a tool that helps to focus your efforts and increase the chances of achieving your goal.

**KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)**
KPIs are a type of performance measurement that evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity in which it engages. They help to understand if the organization is headed in the right direction and if it is achieving its business goals.

**SWOT Analysis**
While SWOT Analysis is a general tool, it can be used to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to business competition or project planning. It is intended to specify the objectives of the business venture or project and identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieving those objectives. 

**PESTEL Analysis**
PESTEL Analysis is a framework or tool used by marketers to analyze and monitor the macro-environmental (external marketing environment) factors that have an impact on an organization. The outcome of PESTEL Analysis can be used to adjust the strategy or identify new goals for the organization.
