# Validation

**description**

"Validation" in business modeling refers to the process of testing and verifying the assumptions and hypotheses that underpin a business model. This process is essential in ensuring that the business model is based on accurate and realistic assumptions, and that it is capable of delivering the expected results.

During the validation phase, the risks, assumptions and hypotheses of the business model are put to the test. This could involve conducting market research to validate customer segments and value propositions, running financial simulations to verify revenue streams and cost structures, or carrying out pilot projects to test key activities and partnerships.

For example, a company might validate its business model by launching a minimum viable product (MVP) to a small segment of its target market. The feedback and data gathered from this MVP launch can then be used to validate or invalidate the assumptions about the product's market fit, pricing strategy, and customer acquisition channels. If the assumptions are validated, the company can proceed with confidence. If they are invalidated, the company can pivot and adjust its business model based on the new insights.

The validation phase is not only about confirming the viability of a business model, but also about learning and adapting. It allows businesses to learn from their mistakes, adapt their strategies, and continuously improve their business models.

In essence, "Validation" in business modeling is about ensuring that a business model is grounded in reality and capable of delivering success. It is a critical aspect of business design, as it directly impacts the ability of a business to survive, thrive, and grow in a competitive market.
