# Business status

**methodologies**

**Balanced Scorecard**
The Balanced Scorecard, developed by Robert Kaplan and David Norton, is a strategic planning and management system that organizations use to monitor and manage their performance. The business status is reflected in the four perspectives of the scorecard: financial, customer, internal process, and learning and growth. Each perspective includes specific performance metrics that provide a comprehensive view of the business's current status.
**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
KPIs are a set of quantifiable measures that a company uses to gauge its performance over time. These metrics are used to determine a company's progress in reaching its strategic and operational goals, and thus reflect the business's current status. KPIs can cover various aspects of a business, including financial performance, customer satisfaction, operational efficiency, and more.
**Benchmarking**
Benchmarking is a process of comparing a business's performance with that of its competitors or industry standards. This comparison provides a clear picture of the business's status in relation to others in the market. It can highlight areas where the business is performing well and where it needs improvement.
**SWOT Analysis**
A SWOT analysis can also be used to understand a business's current status. By identifying the business's strengths and weaknesses (internal factors), and opportunities and threats (external factors), a SWOT analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the current business situation.
**Porter's Five Forces Analysis**
This tool, developed by Michael Porter, is used to analyze the competitive environment of a business. It examines the bargaining power of suppliers and buyers, the threat of new entrants and substitutes, and the intensity of competitive rivalry. This analysis can provide insights into the business's current market position, which is a key aspect of its overall status.
**Financial Ratios**
Financial ratios are numerical comparisons of various aspects of a business's financial performance, such as profitability, liquidity, and solvency ratios. These ratios provide a snapshot of the business's financial status at a particular point in time. They are often used by investors, creditors, and management to assess the business's financial health and performance.
