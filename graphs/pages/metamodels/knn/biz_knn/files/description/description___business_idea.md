# Business idea

**description**

"business idea" refers to the initial concept or thought that forms the basis for a potential business venture. It is the seed from which a business can grow, encompassing the product or service that the business will offer, the target market, and the unique selling proposition that will differentiate the business from its competitors.

The business idea is the starting point for the design of the business, providing the initial vision that guides the development of the business model, strategy, and operations.

For example, the business idea for a tech startup might be "to develop a mobile app that uses artificial intelligence to help individuals manage their personal finances." This idea outlines the product (the mobile app), the target market (individuals needing help with personal finance), and the unique selling proposition (the use of artificial intelligence).

In essence, "business idea" in business modeling is about identifying and articulating the initial concept that forms the basis for a potential business. It is a crucial element in business design, providing the initial vision and direction for the business, and shaping the development of the business model, strategy, and operations.
