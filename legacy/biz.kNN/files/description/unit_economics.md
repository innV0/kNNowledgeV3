# Unit economics

**description**

"Unit Economics" in business modeling refers to the detailed financial analysis that focuses on the revenue and costs associated with a single unit of a product or service. This concept is crucial in understanding the profitability of a business on a per-unit basis, which can provide valuable insights into the overall financial health and sustainability of the business.

Unit Economics involves calculating the direct revenues and costs associated with a single unit of a product or service, to determine the net value or profit margin per unit. This includes factors such as the selling price, the cost of goods sold (COGS), and any direct expenses related to the production, marketing, and delivery of the unit.

For example, if a company sells a product for $100, and the cost of producing and delivering that product is $60, the unit economics would show a profit of $40 per unit. This information can be used to assess the profitability of the product, and to make strategic decisions about pricing, production, and marketing.

Unit Economics is a powerful tool as it allows businesses to understand their cost structures and profit margins in detail. It can help businesses identify which products or services are most profitable, and where there may be opportunities to reduce costs or increase prices. It can also provide a benchmark for comparing the performance of different products, services, or business models.

In conclusion, "Unit Economics" is a fundamental element in business design and modeling. It provides a detailed understanding of the financial performance of a business on a per-unit basis, and it can guide strategic decision-making and business planning.
