**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, "Key Activities" and "Key Resources" often refer to the people or entities that generate value for the business. These could be employees, partners, or even customers themselves (in the case of user-generated content, for example). The "Value Propositions" and "Customer Relationships" components also often involve people as they are about the value delivered to customers and the type of relationship the company establishes with them.
**Value Chain Analysis**
This tool, developed by Michael Porter, breaks down the activities of a company into a series of value-generating steps. People are often involved in many of these steps, either as employees performing tasks or as customers receiving the output of these tasks.
**Job-To-Be-Done Framework**
This tool focuses on understanding the jobs that customers are trying to get done in their lives, and how a company's product or service can help them do these jobs. The "job executor" in this framework is the person or entity that generates value for the business by using the product or service to get a job done.
**Stakeholder Analysis**
This tool identifies and analyzes the people or groups that have a stake in a business or project. These stakeholders often generate value for the business, either directly (as employees or partners) or indirectly (as customers, regulators, or community members).
**Lean Startup Methodology**
This methodology, developed by Eric Ries, emphasizes the importance of learning from customers through a build-measure-learn feedback loop. In this context, customers (the "people" component) generate value for the business by providing feedback on the product or service, which can then be used to improve it.
**User Persona**
This tool involves creating fictional characters based on your real and potential customers. These personas help businesses understand their customers' needs, experiences, behaviors and goals, which in turn helps in creating value for both the business and the customers.
