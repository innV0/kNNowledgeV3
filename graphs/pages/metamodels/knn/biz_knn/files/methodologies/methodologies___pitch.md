# Pitch

**methodologies**

**Elevator Pitch**
The Elevator Pitch is a concise and compelling presentation of a business idea or model, typically lasting no longer than 60 seconds (or the length of an elevator ride). It is designed to grab the attention of potential investors or customers and make them interested in learning more about the business.
**Pitch Deck**
A Pitch Deck is a brief presentation, often created using PowerPoint, Keynote or Prezi, used to provide potential investors or customers with a quick overview of a business plan. It usually includes information about the problem the business solves, the solution it offers, the market size, the business model, the team, and financial projections.
**Value Proposition Canvas**
Developed by Alexander Osterwalder, the Value Proposition Canvas is a tool that helps businesses ensure that their products or services are positioned around what the customer values and needs. The value proposition is often a key component of a business pitch.
**Storytelling**
Storytelling is a powerful tool used in business pitches to engage the audience, make the business idea or model more memorable, and inspire action. A good story can help potential investors or customers understand and connect with the business on a deeper level.
**Problem-Solution Fit**
This concept is often used in business pitches to demonstrate that a business has identified a real problem in the market and has developed a solution that fits that problem. This can help convince potential investors or customers that the business has a viable model.
**Lean Canvas**
The Lean Canvas is a 1-page business plan template that helps businesses deconstruct their idea into key assumptions. It can be used to create a concise and compelling pitch that focuses on the key components of the business model.
