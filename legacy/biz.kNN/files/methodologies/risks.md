# Risks

**methodologies**

**Risk Management Plan**
A Risk Management Plan is a document that a project manager prepares to foresee risks, estimate impacts, and define responses to issues. It also contains a risk assessment matrix. A risk is "an uncertain event or condition that, if it occurs, has a positive or negative effect on a project’s objectives." This tool is used to identify potential risks in the early stages of a project and is a part of the overall project management plan.
**SWOT Analysis**
The SWOT Analysis (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats) is a strategic planning tool used to identify and analyze the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats involved in a project or business. It can be used to identify potential risks (threats) that could negatively affect the business model.
**PESTEL Analysis**
The PESTEL Analysis (Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Environmental, Legal) is a framework or tool used by marketers to analyze and monitor the macro-environmental factors that have an impact on an organization. By understanding these external environments, businesses can maximize the opportunities and minimize the threats to the organization.
**Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS)**
The Risk Breakdown Structure (RBS) is a hierarchical representation of risks according to their risk categories. This tool is used in risk management to help identify and manage potential risks associated with a project or business.
**Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA)**
Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) is a step-by-step approach for identifying all possible failures in a design, a manufacturing or assembly process, or a product or service. It is a common tool for risk assessment and is used to identify potential failure modes, determine their effect on the operation of the product, and identify actions to mitigate the failures.
**Monte Carlo Simulation**
Monte Carlo Simulation is a computerized mathematical technique that allows people to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making. It provides a range of possible outcomes and the probabilities they will occur for any choice of action. It shows the extreme possibilities—the outcomes of going for broke and for the most conservative decision—along with all possible consequences for middle-of-the-road decisions.
