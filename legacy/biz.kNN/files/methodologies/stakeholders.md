It helps to understand the behaviors, interests, expectations, interrelations, and influence of the stakeholders.
**Stakeholder Mapping**
Stakeholder Mapping is a visual tool used to display the different stakeholders involved in a project, policy, or decision. It helps to identify the influence and relationships among stakeholders, allowing businesses to develop a strategic view of the human and organizational landscape, and the relationships between different stakeholders.
**Stakeholder Engagement Plan**
This tool is used to plan the engagement with each stakeholder or stakeholder group. It includes information on the interests, influence, and expectations of the stakeholders, as well as the resources and activities required for the engagement. It helps to ensure that all stakeholders are appropriately engaged in the project, policy, or decision.
**Power/Interest Grid**
This tool is used to prioritize stakeholders based on their power to influence the business and their interest in the business outcomes. It helps to identify which stakeholders need to be fully engaged and managed closely, which stakeholders need to be kept satisfied, which stakeholders need to be adequately informed, and which stakeholders need to be monitored.
**Stakeholder Value Analysis**
Stakeholder Value Analysis is a method used to understand how different stakeholders perceive the value of a business, project, or policy. It helps to identify the key drivers of stakeholder value and to develop strategies to enhance the value proposition for different stakeholders.
