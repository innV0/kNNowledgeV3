# Unfair advantage

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, the "unfair advantage" is not explicitly represented as a separate component. However, it can be incorporated into the "Key Activities", "Key Resources", and "Value Propositions" sections. These sections can include unique attributes or strategies that give the business a competitive edge, such as proprietary technology, exclusive partnerships, or superior brand reputation.
**SWOT Analysis**
The "Strengths" section of a SWOT analysis can be used to identify and articulate a company's unfair advantages. These could be internal factors that the company does better than its competitors, such as a highly skilled workforce, strong financial resources, or a unique business location.
**Value Chain Analysis**
This tool, developed by Michael Porter, can be used to identify a company's unfair advantage by examining its internal activities. If a company can perform certain activities more efficiently or effectively than its competitors, this can be considered an unfair advantage.
**VRIO Framework**
The VRIO framework (Value, Rarity, Imitability, Organization) is a tool for analyzing a company's resources and capabilities to determine if they provide a sustainable competitive advantage. If a resource or capability is valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and the company is organized to exploit it, this can be considered an unfair advantage.
**Blue Ocean Strategy**
This strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne, involves creating a new, uncontested market space (or "blue ocean") rather than competing in an existing market. If a company can successfully implement a blue ocean strategy, this can be considered an unfair advantage as it allows the company to make the competition irrelevant.
**Porter's Five Forces**
While this tool is primarily used to analyze the competitive environment, it can also be used to identify potential unfair advantages. For example, if a company has strong bargaining power over suppliers or buyers, this can be considered an unfair advantage.
