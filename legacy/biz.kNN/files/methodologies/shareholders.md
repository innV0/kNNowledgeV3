**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, the "Key Resources" component can include financial resources, which are part of a company's capital structure. These resources are necessary to create value for the customer. They are considered an input into the company's business model and can include physical, intellectual, human, and financial resources.
**SWOT Analysis**
A SWOT analysis can be used to evaluate a company's capital structure by identifying its financial strengths and weaknesses. For example, a strong capital structure could be a strength, while high levels of debt could be a weakness. Opportunities could include potential investments or funding sources, while threats could include changes in interest rates or other financial risks.
**Porter's Five Forces**
This tool can be used to analyze a company's competitive environment, which can impact its capital structure. For example, high levels of competition could lead to lower profits and a weaker capital structure, while strong bargaining power with suppliers could lead to better terms and a stronger capital structure.
**Financial Ratio Analysis**
Financial ratios, such as the debt-to-equity ratio or the current ratio, can be used to analyze a company's capital structure. These ratios can provide insights into the company's financial health and its ability to meet its financial obligations.
**PESTEL Analysis**
A PESTEL analysis can help a company understand how external factors may impact its capital structure. For example, changes in economic conditions can affect interest rates, which can impact a company's cost of capital. Similarly, changes in legal regulations can affect a company's ability to raise capital.
**Value Chain Analysis**
This tool can be used to understand how a company's activities contribute to its value creation and costs. This can provide insights into the company's capital structure, as different activities may require different levels of investment and generate different returns.
