# Problems

**description**

"Problems" in business modeling refers to problems that your target customer faces in relation to your product or service. Focus on issues that are significant and frequent enough to motivate potential customers to seek a solution. These problems should be specific, actionable, and directly tied to the value your product aims to deliver. Avoid generic statements, and instead, use clear, concise descriptions based on customer research or insights.  The aim is to create a comprehensive understanding of each profile, which can then be used to tailor products, services, and marketing efforts to achieve the set goals.

The "Problems" section is where you clearly define the key challenges, pain points, or needs of your target customers. It focuses on identifying the top three problems they face and understanding their current solutions or workarounds. This section sets the foundation for designing a solution that effectively addresses these issues. List the most significant problems or frustrations your target customers face. These should be specific and relevant to the audience you're focusing on. Identify how customers are currently solving these problems. This could include competitor products, manual processes, or makeshift solutions. Highlight inefficiencies or limitations in these existing alternatives to showcase the opportunity for your solution.

Gather insights from customer interviews, surveys, or research to ensure the problems are real and significant. Avoid assumptions and validate the issues with actual data from your target audience. Ensure the problems are tied to a specific customer segment. This focus helps tailor your solution and business model to their unique needs. By thoroughly understanding and defining the problems in this section, you establish the basis for your Unique Value Proposition and Solution sections. Solving a well-identified problem is the key to building a product or service that resonates with your customers and succeeds in the market.
