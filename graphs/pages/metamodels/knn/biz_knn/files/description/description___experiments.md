# Experiments

**description**

"Experiment List" in business modeling refers to a systematic list of tests or trials designed to validate the assumptions and hypotheses about a business model's value proposition, customer segments, and revenue streams. This list is used as a roadmap to test and validate the viability and effectiveness of a business model before its full-scale implementation.

An experiment list can include various types of tests depending on the specific aspects of the business model that need validation. For instance, it may include customer interviews to validate assumptions about customer needs and preferences. It may also include prototype testing to validate the feasibility and attractiveness of a product or service offering.

Moreover, an experiment list can also include market tests to validate assumptions about the size and profitability of a market segment. It may also include financial tests to validate assumptions about revenue streams and cost structures.

The experiment list serves as a structured approach to risk management in business design and modeling. It helps business leaders and stakeholders to identify and address potential flaws and weaknesses in a business model before they become costly mistakes. It also provides valuable insights and learnings that can be used to refine and improve the business model.

In conclusion, an experiment list is a critical tool in business design and modeling. It provides a systematic and evidence-based approach to validating the key assumptions and hypotheses of a business model, reducing risks and increasing the chances of success. It is a crucial component of a lean and agile business model, promoting continuous learning and adaptation in response to market feedback and changes.
