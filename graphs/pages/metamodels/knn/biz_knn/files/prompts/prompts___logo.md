`Sketch three distinct logo concepts and explain the symbolism in each.`
`What logo style (wordmark, emblem, abstract) best fits our brand personality?`
`How should our logo scale across different formats (web, print, signage)?`
`Which color and monochrome versions are necessary for versatility?`
`What criteria will we use to select the final logo design?`
