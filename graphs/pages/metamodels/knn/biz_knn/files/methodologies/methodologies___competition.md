# Competition

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, "competition" is not explicitly mentioned but is an integral part of the "market forces" in the environment map. This includes the competitive landscape, market segments, needs and demands, market issues, and switching costs. Understanding the competition helps in defining the value proposition and customer segments.
**Porter's Five Forces**
This tool, developed by Michael Porter, is specifically designed to analyze the competitive environment of a business. It includes the analysis of the threat of new entrants, the threat of substitute products or services, the bargaining power of customers, the bargaining power of suppliers, and the intensity of competitive rivalry.
**SWOT Analysis**
The SWOT analysis can be used to identify the strengths and weaknesses of a business in relation to its competition. Opportunities and threats in the competitive landscape can also be identified.
**Competitive Positioning Model**
This model helps a business to identify its competitive advantage in its market segment. It involves understanding the competition, and then differentiating oneself by providing superior value.
**Value Net Model**
Developed by Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff, this model looks at business competition and cooperation. It identifies four types of players in the competitive game: Customers, Suppliers, Competitors, and Complementors. Understanding these players helps in strategizing and creating value.
**Blue Ocean Strategy**
This strategy, developed by W. Chan Kim and Ren√©e Mauborgne, involves creating a new, uncontested market space (or "Blue Ocean") rather than competing in an existing market, which is often saturated and highly competitive ("Red Ocean").
**PESTEL Analysis**
The PESTEL analysis can help identify how external factors might affect the competition within a market segment. For example, changes in legal regulations might affect the competitive landscape.
