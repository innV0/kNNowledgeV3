**methodologies**

**Balanced Scorecard**
The Balanced Scorecard is a strategic planning and management system that organizations use to align business activities with the vision and strategy of the organization, improve internal and external communications, and monitor organization performance against strategic goals. It includes financial metrics, customer metrics, process metrics, and people metrics.
**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)**
KPIs are a type of performance measurement that evaluate the success of an organization or of a particular activity in which it engages. They are tied to target values and are used to measure the effectiveness of a business model in achieving key business objectives.
**OKRs (Objectives and Key Results)**
OKRs are a goal-setting framework for defining and tracking objectives and their outcomes. The main goal of OKRs is to connect company, team, and personal objectives to measurable results, making all employees work together in one unified direction.
**Dashboarding**
Dashboards are a visual display of the most important information needed to achieve one or more objectives, consolidated and arranged on a single screen so the information can be monitored at a glance. They can be used to track the metrics and other data relevant to a business, department, or specific process.
**Benchmarking**
Benchmarking is the process of comparing your business processes and performance metrics to industry bests or best practices from other industries. It can be applied against any product, process, function or approach in business.
**Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
NPS is a customer loyalty metric that measures customersâ€™ willingness to not only return for another purchase or service but also make a recommendation to their family, friends or colleagues. It is a powerful and straightforward metric that can be used to measure a customer's perception of a brand.
**Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)**
CLV is a prediction of the net profit attributed to the entire future relationship with a customer. This metric helps businesses understand a reasonable cost per acquisition.
