The logo, as a visual representation of the brand, plays a crucial role in this model. It helps to communicate the brand's personality, culture, self-image, reflection, relationship, and physique to the target audience.
**Brand Equity Model**
Also known as the Brand Resonance Model, this tool developed by Kevin Lane Keller measures the value of a brand in the customer's mind. The logo, as a part of brand identity, contributes to brand salience (how often and easily the brand is evoked under various situations or circumstances).

This is a specific methodology used to create a logo. It involves understanding the brand, researching the industry and competition, sketching and conceptualizing, refining, and finally, testing the logo in various contexts.
