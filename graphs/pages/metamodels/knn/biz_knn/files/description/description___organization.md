# Organization

**description**

An Organization provides the structural and legal context in which people, positions, tools, and processes operate. It defines the boundaries of responsibility, governance, and ownership of the workflow. Organizations allocate resources, enforce standards, and determine strategic goals. Examples include companies, departments, institutions, or cross-functional teams.
