# Projections

**methodologies**

**Financial Forecasting**
Financial forecasting is a fundamental tool for cashflow projections. It involves estimating the future financial outcomes for a company. The forecast estimates what the cash inflows (revenues) and outflows (expenses) will be. This tool is essential for planning and budgeting purposes.

**Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Analysis**
DCF analysis is a method of valuing a project, company, or asset using the concepts of the time value of money. It uses future free cash flow projections and discounts them to arrive at a present value, which is then used to evaluate the potential for investment.

**Net Present Value (NPV) Analysis**
NPV analysis is a method used to calculate the value of a cash inflow produced by an investment, adjusted for time value of money. It's a core component of corporate budgeting and uses cashflow projections as a key input.

**Internal Rate of Return (IRR) Analysis**
IRR is a metric used in capital budgeting to estimate the profitability of potential investments. It is the discount rate that makes the net present value (NPV) of all cash flows equal to zero. Cashflow projections are essential to calculate IRR.

**Break-Even Analysis**
This is a calculation that determines the point at which revenue equals the costs associated with receiving that revenue. It uses cashflow projections to determine the sales volume required to cover costs and start making a profit.

**Sensitivity Analysis**
Sensitivity analysis is a tool used to understand how the different values of an independent variable impact a particular dependent variable under a given set of assumptions. In the context of cashflow projections, it helps to understand how changes in inputs (like sales volume, price, cost of goods sold, etc.) impact the cashflow.

**Scenario Analysis**
Scenario analysis is a process of examining and evaluating possible events or scenarios that could take place in the future and predicting the various possible outcomes. It uses cashflow projections to understand the impact of different scenarios on the company's cashflow.
