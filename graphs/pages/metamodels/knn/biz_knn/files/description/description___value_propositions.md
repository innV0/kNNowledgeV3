# Value propositions

**description**

"value proposition" refers to the unique combination of products or services that a company offers to solve the problems or meet the specific needs of a particular customer profile. It is the unique value that a company promises to deliver to its customers, and the reason why customers should choose this company over its competitors. 

The value proposition is a critical component of business design as it defines the company's competitive advantage, shapes its business strategy, and drives its business operations. It is the foundation of a company's relationship with its customers and the key to its market success.

For instance, a software company may offer a unique value proposition to its business customers by providing innovative, reliable, and user-friendly software solutions that help businesses improve their productivity, reduce their costs, and grow their revenues. The company may also offer superior customer service, technical support, and training to ensure that its customers can fully utilize its software and achieve their business goals.

The software company's value proposition is not just about its software. It is about the total value that the company delivers to its customers, including the the benefits that its software brings to its customers, quality of its software, and the support that the company provides to its customers. It is about how the company solves its customers' problems, meets their needs, and creates value for them.

In essence, the value proposition is a strategic tool that enables businesses to differentiate themselves from their competitors, attract and retain their customers, and achieve their business goals. It is the heart of business design and a key driver of business success.
