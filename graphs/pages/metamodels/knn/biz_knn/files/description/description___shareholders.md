"Capital Structure" in business modeling refers to the mix of financial resources, assets, and investments that a business utilizes to generate income and support its operations. This structure is not randomly assembled, but strategically designed to optimize the financial performance and sustainability of the business.

In a business model, the "Capital Structure" is a fundamental component as it determines how the business finances its overall operations and growth. It includes both debt and equity, which are the two primary sources of financing for any business. The balance between these two sources is crucial as it impacts the risk and return profile of the business.

The composition of the "Capital Structure" can vary depending on the nature of the business, its financial strategy, and its risk tolerance. It can include resources such as retained earnings, equity shares, bonds, loans, or other forms of debt. Each component of the capital structure has a cost associated with it, and the goal is to minimize this cost to maximize the profitability of the business.

For example, in a manufacturing business, the "Capital Structure" might include sources such as equity from shareholders, loans from banks for purchasing machinery and equipment, and retained earnings for reinvestment into the business. The balance between these sources is carefully managed to ensure the financial stability and growth of the business.

"Capital Structure" in business modeling is not just about assembling the sources of financing. It's about strategically managing these resources to optimize the financial performance of the business. It's about creating a structure that can effectively support the business operations and contribute to its financial sustainability and growth.

In conclusion, the "Capital Structure" concept in business modeling is a critical element that contributes to the financial success and sustainability of the business. It emphasizes the importance of strategically managing the financial resources, assets, and investments in a business model.
