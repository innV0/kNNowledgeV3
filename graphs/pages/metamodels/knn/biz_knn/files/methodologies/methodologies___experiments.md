# Experiments

**methodologies**

**Lean Startup Methodology**
The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, emphasizes the importance of conducting experiments to validate business assumptions. The methodology encourages businesses to create a "Minimum Viable Product" (MVP) and use it to test key business hypotheses. The feedback received from these experiments is then used to iterate and improve the business model.
**Design Thinking**
Design Thinking is a problem-solving approach that involves empathizing with users, defining problems, ideating solutions, prototyping, and testing. The testing phase often involves conducting experiments to validate the solutions developed during the ideation phase. These experiments can provide valuable insights into the value proposition, customer segments, and revenue streams of a business model.
**Business Model Canvas**
The Business Model Canvas, developed by Alexander Osterwalder, includes a component called "channels" which can be used to design and conduct experiments. These experiments can test assumptions about how a company communicates and delivers its value proposition to its customer segments.
**Value Proposition Canvas**
This tool, also developed by Alexander Osterwalder, is designed to help businesses understand their customers' needs and create products and services that meet those needs. It encourages businesses to conduct experiments to validate their assumptions about their value proposition and customer segments.
**Pivot or Persevere**
This is a decision-making process used in the Lean Startup methodology. After conducting experiments, businesses use the results to decide whether to pivot (make a fundamental change to the business model) or persevere (keep improving the current model). This process is crucial for validating a business model's value proposition, customer segments, and revenue streams.
**Growth Hacking**
Growth Hacking is a marketing strategy that focuses on rapid experimentation across marketing channels and product development to identify the most effective ways to grow a business. These experiments can provide valuable insights into a business model's value proposition, customer segments, and revenue streams.
