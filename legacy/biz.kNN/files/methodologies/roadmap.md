# Roadmap

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, the "Key Activities" component can be used to outline the steps and strategies needed to implement a business model solution. This includes the most important actions a company must take to operate successfully, such as production, problem-solving, and training.
**Lean Startup Methodology**
The Lean Startup methodology, developed by Eric Ries, emphasizes the creation of a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) and then using customer feedback to iterate and improve. The roadmap in this context is a plan for developing and refining the solution based on customer feedback.
**Agile Development**
Agile development is a methodology that emphasizes flexibility, customer collaboration, and responsiveness to change. The roadmap in Agile development is a high-level view of the productâ€™s development, outlining the steps and strategies needed to implement the solution.
**Gantt Chart**
A Gantt chart is a visual representation of a project schedule, showing the start and finish dates of the terminal elements and summary elements of a project. It can be used as a roadmap to outline the steps and strategies needed to implement a business model solution.
**SWOT Analysis**
A SWOT analysis can be used to identify the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to a business model solution. This can help in the creation of a roadmap by identifying potential challenges and opportunities that may arise during the implementation of the solution.
**PESTEL Analysis**
A PESTEL analysis can be used to identify how external macro-environmental factors might affect the implementation of a business model solution. This can help in the creation of a roadmap by providing insights into potential challenges and opportunities that may arise from political, economic, social, technological, environmental, and legal factors.
