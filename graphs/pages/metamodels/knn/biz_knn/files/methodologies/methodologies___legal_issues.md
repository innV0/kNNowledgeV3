# Legal issues

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, "legal issues" can be considered as part of the "Key Activities" and "Key Resources" components. Key Activities might include ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, while Key Resources might include legal expertise or advice. Legal issues can also be considered as part of the "Cost Structure", as legal compliance and advice can be a significant cost for businesses.
**PESTEL Analysis**
The "Legal" component of the PESTEL Analysis directly addresses legal issues. This includes analyzing the impact of current and potential laws and regulations on the business model. It can also involve considering the potential risks and opportunities associated with changes in the legal environment.
**SWOT Analysis**
Legal issues can be considered as part of the "Threats" or "Opportunities" in a SWOT Analysis. For example, changes in laws or regulations could pose a threat to the current business model, or they could present an opportunity for a new business model.
**Risk Management Framework**
This tool can be used to identify and manage legal risks associated with the business model. This might include risks associated with non-compliance with laws and regulations, or risks associated with legal disputes or litigation.
**Compliance Management Systems**
These systems are designed to ensure that a company is aware of and complies with all relevant laws and regulations. This can include systems for monitoring changes in the legal environment, systems for ensuring compliance with laws and regulations, and systems for managing legal disputes or litigation.
**Legal Design Thinking**
This is a methodology that applies design thinking principles to legal issues. It involves understanding the user's needs, ideating solutions, prototyping, and testing. This can be used to design business models that are not only legally compliant, but also user-friendly and efficient.
