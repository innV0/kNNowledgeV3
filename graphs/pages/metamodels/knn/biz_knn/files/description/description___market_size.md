# Market size

**description**

"market size" refers to the identification and quantification of a specific group of potential customers (segment) within a market that a company aims to reach with its products or services. This segment is typically defined by certain characteristics (segmentation criteria) such as age, income, geography, or behavior, which the company believes will make these customers more likely to purchase its offerings.

The market size, on the other hand, is the total number of potential customers or the total revenue potential within the identified segment. It provides an estimate of the maximum potential that a business can hope to achieve if it were to capture the entire market segment.

For example, a company that produces organic baby food might identify its market segment as health-conscious parents of infants and toddlers. The market size would then be determined by the total number of such parents, or alternatively, the total amount they spend on baby food annually.

"market size" is crucial in business modeling as it helps a company to focus its resources on the most promising customers, tailor its offerings to meet their specific needs, and estimate the potential revenue it can generate. It is a fundamental aspect of business design, shaping the company's marketing strategy, product development, and overall business strategy. It influences how the company positions itself in the market, competes with other businesses, and achieves its financial goals.
