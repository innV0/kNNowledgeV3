**Value Chain Analysis**
Developed by Michael Porter, the Value Chain Analysis is a tool that helps to identify and examine the various activities that contribute to the delivery of a product or service. These activities are categorized into primary activities (such as inbound logistics, operations, outbound logistics, marketing and sales, and service) and support activities (such as procurement, technology development, human resource management, and firm infrastructure). The "operations" component specifically refers to the processes of transforming inputs into finished products.
  
**Business Process Modeling Notation (BPMN)**
BPMN is a graphical representation for specifying business processes in a business process model. It provides businesses with a standard method of illustrating the flow of activities in a process, including operations. This can help businesses to visualize, understand, and improve their operational processes.

**Lean Manufacturing**
Lean Manufacturing is a methodology that focuses on minimizing waste within manufacturing systems while simultaneously maximizing productivity. It can be applied to the operations component of a business model to streamline processes, reduce costs, and improve efficiency and quality.

**Six Sigma**
Six Sigma is a set of techniques and tools for process improvement. It seeks to improve the quality of process outputs by identifying and removing the causes of defects and minimizing variability in manufacturing and business processes. It can be applied to the operations component of a business model to improve operational efficiency and effectiveness.

**Total Quality Management (TQM)**
TQM is a management approach to long-term success through customer satisfaction. It involves all members of an organization participating in improving processes, products, services, and the culture in which they work. This can be applied to the operations component of a business model to ensure that all operational processes are aligned with the goal of delivering high-quality products or services.

**Supply Chain Operations Reference (SCOR) Model**
The SCOR Model is a process reference model that provides a cross-industry standard for supply chain management. It describes the business activities associated with all phases of satisfying a customer's demand. This can be applied to the operations component of a business model to manage and optimize the supply chain operations.
