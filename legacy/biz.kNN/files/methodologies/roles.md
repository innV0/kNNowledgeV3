# Roles

**methodologies**

**Business Model Canvas**
In the Business Model Canvas, "Key Partnerships" and "Customer Segments" are two of the nine key components. The roles involved in the purchasing decision can be identified and analyzed within these components. For instance, the "Key Partnerships" can include those who influence the purchasing decision, while the "Customer Segments" can help identify the roles of different customers in the purchasing process.
**Value Proposition Canvas**
This tool, which is a supplement to the Business Model Canvas, allows businesses to dive deeper into the customer's needs and wants. The "Customer Profile" section can help identify the roles of different individuals involved in the purchasing decision, and how the product or service can meet their specific needs.
**Stakeholder Analysis**
This tool is used to identify and understand the needs and interests of everyone who has a stake in a project or decision. In the context of purchasing decisions, this can include anyone from the end user to the financial director. The stakeholder analysis can help identify these roles and understand their influence on the purchasing decision.
**Buyer Persona**
This marketing tool involves creating a detailed profile of an ideal customer. This can include their role in the purchasing decision, their needs and wants, and how they would use the product or service. This tool can help businesses understand and cater to the specific roles involved in the purchasing decision.
**Journey Mapping**
Similar to the Customer Journey Map, this tool involves mapping out the entire purchasing process from the customer's perspective. This can help identify the roles of different individuals at each stage of the process, and how they influence the purchasing decision.
**PESTEL Analysis**
By analyzing Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Ecological, and Legal factors, companies can identify how these external factors affect the roles involved in the purchasing decision. For example, legal regulations might dictate who can make certain purchasing decisions in a company.
