**Empathy Map**
An Empathy Map is a tool that helps businesses gain insight into their customers. It is divided into sections that represent what the customer Says, Thinks, Does, and Feels. This tool can be used to create a detailed profile of a customer persona, including their needs, motivations, and challenges.

**Customer Persona Canvas**
This tool is specifically designed to create detailed customer personas. It includes sections for demographic information, goals and tasks, motivations, and pain points. By filling out the canvas, businesses can create a comprehensive profile of their target customers.

**Value Proposition Canvas**
Developed by Alexander Osterwalder, the Value Proposition Canvas is a tool that helps businesses understand how their products or services can meet the needs of their customers. One half of the canvas is dedicated to the customer profile, which includes the customer's jobs, pains, and gains.

**Jobs To Be Done Framework**
This framework is used to understand the 'job' that a customer hires a product or service to do. By understanding this 'job', businesses can create a detailed profile of their customers, including their needs, motivations, and the context in which they use the product or service.

**Experience Map**
An Experience Map is a visual representation of a customer's journey with a product or service. It includes all the touchpoints a customer has with the business, and can be used to create a detailed profile of the customer, including their needs, motivations, and challenges at each touchpoint.

**SWOT Analysis**
While SWOT Analysis is a more general tool, it can be used to understand the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats related to a specific customer persona. This can help businesses understand how to better meet the needs of their customers and identify potential challenges or opportunities.

**PESTEL Analysis**
By analyzing Political, Economic, Social, Technological, Ecological, and Legal factors, companies can understand how these external factors affect their customer personas. For example, technological advancements can change the needs and behaviors of customers, which would need to be reflected in their profiles.
